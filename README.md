A simple, type-safe way to create multi-dimensional arrays

## Features

-   ðŸ›¸ Easily create multi-dimensional arrays, with as many dimensions as needed
-   ðŸŽ› Define exact dimensions to create an array of specified size
-   ðŸ”¢ Initialise every point in the array to a custom or self-aware starting value
-   ðŸ“œ Comes with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) definitions and type-safe returns
-   ðŸ”¬ Tiny size ([~500 bytes gzipped](https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=make-matrix)), with no external dependencies

## Installation

Install the package from NPM, and import it into your JavaScript or TypeScript file:

```bash
npm install make-matrix
```

```js
import makeMatrix from "make-matrix";
```

## Usage

### Create a matrix

To simply create an array of `n` dimensions, just pass `n` as the function's first parameter. And to create an array with exact dimensions, pass in an array of numbers.

```js
// create a 2D array
const twoDimensionalArray = makeMatrix(2);

// create an array of size 3x3x2
const threeByThreeByTwoArray = makeMatrix([3, 3, 2]);
```

### Initialise the matrix with set values

By default each point in the matrix will be initialised to `null` (so that if reading a point returns `undefined`, you know that it exists outside the current bounds of the matrix). To fill each point with a custom initial value, pass that value as the function's second parameter, `initialValues`:

```js
// create a 3x5 array, with each point equal to 0
const twoDimensionalNumberArray = makeMatrix([3, 5], 0);

// create a 2x6x5 array, with each point equal to "value"
const threeDimensionalStringArray = makeMatrix([2, 6, 5], "value");
```

### Pass a callback for dynamic initial values

The `initialValues` parameter can also be a callback, which you can use to dynamically create items for each position in the matrix. The callback can also accept an argument which will resolve to the current vector co-ordinates at each point in the matrix. This will allow you to populate your matrix in a "self-aware" fashion.

```js
// create a 10x10x10 array, with each point a different random number between 0 and 9
const twoDRandomNumberArray = makeMatrix([10, 10, 10], () => Math.floor(Math.random() * 10));

// create a 5x5 array, with each point self-described by a string
const twoDVectorStringArray = makeMatrix([5, 5], (vector) => `I am at position ${vector.join()}`);

// create a 7x3x8 array, with each point transformed into a vector object
const twoDVectorObjectArray = makeMatrix([7, 3, 8], ([x, y, z]) => ({ x, y, z }));
```

## With TypeScript

This package comes with type definitions to provide type-safety when working with the returned arrays.

Returned Matrices will be given a specific type dictated by `T` and the number of dimensions, where `T` is the type of the value passed to the functions `initialValues` parameter (or `unknown`, if not set).

For example, a three-dimensional array of numbers will be of type `number[][][]`. Points within the matrix can then only be reassigned to numbers. TypeScript's compiler will present errors when any reassignments are of the wrong type, including if they are at an incorrect depth in the array. This type-safety also occurs when callbacks are used to dynamically populate your matrix.

```ts
const threeDNumberArray = makeMatrix([2, 6, 5], 0); // return type of number[][][]

threeDNumberArray[2][1][2] = 10;      // âœ… OK

threeDNumberArray[2][1][2] = false;   // ðŸš¨ error: Type 'false' is not assignable to type 'number'

threeDNumberArray[2][1] = 10;         // ðŸš¨ error: Type number is not assignable to type 'number[]'

threeDNumberArray[2][1][2][0] = 10;   // ðŸš¨ error: Property '0' does not exist on type 'Number'
```

This type-safety will work for any number of dimensions, however large numbers may slow down the typescript compiler, due to the recursive nature of the types working under the hood.

Please also be aware thatâ€”when using this function with a primitive instead of a literal type, such as when creating matrices of dynamic sizeâ€”the compiler will error as below. This is an unfortunate limitation with recursive types that can't be worked around. Instead, you'll have to use a `// @ts-ignore` statement.

```ts
const dimensions: number[] = [2, 6, 5];
const threeDNumberArray = makeMatrix(dimensions, 0); // ðŸš¨ error: Type instantiation is excessively deep and possibly infinite
```

## Example

To easily create a 3D grid using [p5.js](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/), make-matrix can be used like below. The source code for the grid at the top of this readme [can be seen here](https://github.com/neefrehman/Generative/blob/master/src/sketches/20/05/120520.tsx), and an [interactive demo of it here](https://generative.neef.co/120520).

```js
const res = 10; // 10px grid resolution
const matrix = makeMatrix([5, 5, 5]); // A 5x5x5 cube grid

for (let x = 0; x < matrix.length; x += res) {
    for (let y = 0; y < matrix[x].length; y += res) {
        for (let z = 0; z < matrix[x][y].length; z += res) {
            line(x, y, z, x + res, y, z);
            line(x, y, z, x, y + res, z);
            line(x, y, z, x, y, z + res);
        }
    }
}
```

## API

```ts
makeMatrix<D, T>(
    dimensions: D | VectorOfLength<D>,
    initialValues?: T | ((vector: VectorOfLength<D>) => T) = null
): Matrix<D, T>;
```

### Parameters

| Name  | Description  |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| `dimensions`  | The desired dimensions of the matrix. A number or array of numbers.  |
| `initialValues`  | The value that each point in the matrix will initialise to. Can take any value. If a callback is passed, it will be run for each point in the matrix, which will be initialised to the callbacks returned value. (Optional â€” defaults to `null`).  |

### Returns

| Name  | Description  |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| `Matrix`  | A multidimensional array of your desired dimensions, with each point initialised to equal the `initialValues` parameter (or its returned value).  |
